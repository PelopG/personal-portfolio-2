# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I set out to build a portfolio website for the second time to practice more of my skills on web-development.
Another reason is because I wanted my portfolio to be a single page rather than having different pages and need to go back and forth each time.

## Skills

- Development of new knowledge and understanding of javascript, css and html.
- New skill on how to debug code for web development.
- Used Prettier-code formatter to enforce consistent code styling.
- Used Live Server to test and simulate the website.

## Usage

Feel free to walk around my website and if you found it interesting let me know.
